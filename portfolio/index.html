									TD rush is a single player rhythm game on PC(Windows). In the game, players need 
									to press correct button accroding to the signals shown to get high scores. The 
									intention of making this game was my TD Line experience. TD Line is a physical 
									exercise facility in my university. Students need to jump, climb and run to pass 
									it. Their movements was quite rhythmical, so I made it into a game.
