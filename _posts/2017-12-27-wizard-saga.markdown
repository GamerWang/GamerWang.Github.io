My teammates and I like adventure games, and we found that a lot of these games could be improved and played on mobile platform. So we started this project.

We decided on the major process of this game: player need to release the magic to beat the enemy, and try to make the character stronger through adventures. In order to know if the process was interesting and find a proper way of playing, I first made a demo myself, in which I realized 15 skill prototypes and 4 operation modes that support the movement, attack and doge. After multiple tests and evaluations, we finalized on some interesting skills and optimal operation modes.

We made a detaile project design then, and determined on the major game functions and development techniques. I studied and solved the key issues, such as AI, data management, 2.5D, dungeon generation, scene display. Then, I decided on the project version management based on git to ensure the proper cooperation and version maintenance. Righer now, we are in the process of development.

This is my first team work based game development project working with people who don't know the knowledge of programming. This experience made me realize the difference between game development and software development, as well as helped me to form a feasible set of game development methods. Furthermore, I learned what need to consider under the pressure of budgets. Last but not least, I greatly improved my programming skills trying to meet the games's new requrements.
